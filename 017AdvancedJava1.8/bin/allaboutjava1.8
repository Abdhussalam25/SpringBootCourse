Features in Java8
-------------------
1. Interface Enhancement
2. Functional Interface
3. Lambda Expression
4. Stream API
5. Date & Time API

What is Lambda expression?
To provide implementation of interfaces with less code.

Lamda expression consist of 3 componensts:
1.Argument list: parameters passed it can be empty

Functional Interface

=============

Stream APi======
A sequence of elements in collection from a container



Q.
We have a functional interface PrintMessageInNewLine having 
abstract method called printMessageInNewLine(String message)

Streams====
java.util.stream
we have java.io.stream where we have file related operations
util.stream to work on collection operators
1) Filter -- filtering acc to condition
2) Map -- repeat some operation on each 
     element  ex -  a -> a*3
3)distinct()
4) sorted()
5)skip(long n) it will skip no of elements which we are specifying in the object.
6)peek() is useful for debugging the operation whether it is functioning properly or not.

Terminating opeations
1)count()  -- to count the no of elements inside the stream.
2)foreach
3)collect(Collectors.toList)


// Note colon operator can be possible only if there is no arguments bcoz we have to call without paranthesis.
filter is a lazy opearation ins stream
