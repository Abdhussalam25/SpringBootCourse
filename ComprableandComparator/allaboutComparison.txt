========Comparable interface
	In this interface,method called cmpareTo can be used  to compare the same type of objects
	It is used to provide natural sorting order of objects
	It was introduces in java 1.0
	

public interface Comparable<E>{
public int compareTo(Object object);

}
Note: It is used to compare the current object with specified object.

if it returns positive, when current(this) object is greater than specified object
if it returns negative, when current(this) object is smaller than specified object
if it returns zero, when current(this) object is equal to the specified object

Product 
as user defined class implements Comparable<Product>
                                 -------------------Note here

==============Comparator Interface==========
It is another Interface used to compare two user defined object

public interface Comparator<E>{
public int compare (object ob1, ob2)
}
Note: It is used to compare the Two objects of same type.

if it returns positive, when  object1 is greater than specified object2
if it returns negative, when  object1 is smaller than specified object2
if it returns zero, when  object1 is equal to the specified object2

Here we need one extra class and this will be very easy to apply

if type of objects are not compatible for comparison then it throw ClassCastException
