
SERVER -- Servlets/JST

Middleware between client and database/application/


SERVER

   javaclass used to extend the capablities of server

3 ways to create servlet/server

1)user defined servlet
2)generic servlet ----- 
3)extend HTTPServlet directly

doGet, all informations will be in url
doPost -- quite sequre -- 
informations will be in headers 

SERVLET lifeCycle?

init();
service()
destry()--- released all resources that servlet consumed.
garbage collection by JVM.


inti method == 


web.xml configuration

what do u mean by http is a stateless protocall?

    to make the server not overloaded

http get is specially designed to get resouce which already exists
post is specially designed creating new resources
put is for updating resources
delete is for delete resources


===
SErvlet confign  and servlet context

only one servlet context

include -- wharever the current output you have that also included


FILTERS;;;

EVENTS and LISTENERS

Whenever fist time servelet called it is called servelet context event

What are the usage of Servlet Config, 
What is the usage Servlet Context?
What is the usage of Listeners?
What is the usage of Filters?
usage of enumuration... ====> to store the immutable objects

Enumeration <String>enums=session.getAttributeNames();
enums.hasMoreElements()
str=enums.nextElement();
Enumeration <String>enums=session.getAttributeNames();
		out.print("<br>Showing session objects added:");
		String str=null;
		while(enums.hasMoreElements()) {

			str=enums.nextElement();
			out.print("<br>"+str+":<input type='text' value='"+session.getValue(str)+"'disabled/>");	
		}

Important method and its functions of above four?

How to create Session?

Servlet connecting client with jdbc,jni,javaapplication,soapservices,webservices

--->Though servlet can respond to any type of client 
request they are commonly used in web context.

--->Control part of MVC architecture

---->servlets are platform independent because they are written in java
servlets are trusted
it can communicate with applets,databases,or other software via the sockets and RMI mechanisms
